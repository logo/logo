# logo

  Easily include a logo on your site without editing images.

  With this component as the base, you can build up logos that are resolution-independent and can be rendered with a just an HTML class, like so:

```html
<div class="logo" data-logo="New York Times">
  <span>New York Times</span>
</div>
```

  The tags themselves aren't important. Say it was in the header of your site:

```html
<a class="logo" data-logo="Your Company">
  <h1>Your Company</h1>
</a>
```

  Or even a simple in-line logo:

```html
<p>Powered by <a class="logo" data-logo="Firebase"><span>Firebase</span></a>.</p>
```

  That's the beauty of it!

## API

  This component is the base component for all other logos. Just require this repository as a dependency in your `component.json` for the base styles, and then add the custom styles and SVG images.

    $ component install logo/logo

## CLI

  There's also a CLI which makes working with the logos easier. You can install it with:

    $ npm install -g logo-cli

#### logo create \<name\>

  Create a new logo repository named `name`. The CLI will prompt you for all the required information and then generate the repo's folder.

#### logo resize

  Automatically determine the CSS `width` property of the logo based on the CSS margins and the `.svg` file dimensions. This command will update the `index.css` file with the newly computed `width`. That way you can you just edit the margins as you please, and you don't have to keep doing tedious math to keep the width in sync.
